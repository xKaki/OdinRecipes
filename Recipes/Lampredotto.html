    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Panini di lampredotto is a sandwich that consists of tripe, made from cow’s fourth stomach cooked in a variety of ways but usually topped with salsa verde. The trip consists of two separate layers of meat; one lean, dark and flavorful, and one pale, fatty, and relatively blunt. The meat is prepared in a broth similarly like the shkembe chorba (tripe soup) we previously featured on our website. Once ready, the meat is added in a sandwich and topped with some delicious salsa verde (and yes, we’ll show you how to do that too).</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 kg Tripe </li>
