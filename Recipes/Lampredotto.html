            2 Tablespoon Salt
        
        Salsa Verde
        
            1 Small Onion Cubed
            1 Garlic Clove
            2-3 Basil Leaves
            1/2 Stems Parsley
            Olive Oil
            3 Tablespoons Capers
            2 Tiny Anchovies
            1 Teaspoon Lime Juice
        
        Sandwich
        
            4 Large Unsalted Bread Buns
        
        Instructions
        The Lampredotto
        
        1.1 Chop the vegetables and add them to the water.
        
        1.2 Season the broth with salt and peppercorns and cook for 10-15 minutes.
        
        1.3 Add the lampredotto and cook it covered with a lid until it becomes soft. This should take between 40 and 60 minutes.
        
        1.4 Make sure the lampredotto is submerged under the stew all the time.
        
        1.5 Keep the lampredotto warm and in the broth until it becomes time to use it.
        The Salsa Verde
        
        2.1 Chop the vegetables, herbs, and anchovies together and
        add some lime juice and olive oil.
        
        2.2 Mix everything until you get a paste-like consistency.
        
        2.3 Taste and see if anything else needs to be added. The sauce needs to be green, so if itâ€™s not green enough, add more parsley. This is the main ingredient of salsa verde.
        
        2.4 Season with salt and pepper
        Assembling the sandwich
        
        3.1 Take a big piece of lampredotto out from the pot and chop it into tiny pieces.
        
        3.2 Split the bread buns in half and take some of the bread in the middle out to make space for the filling
        
        3.3 Add three tablespoons of salsa verde (on the lampredotto) per sandwich and season with more salt and pepper.
        
        3.4 Optional: Dip the top half of the sandwich into the broth to add some flavor, serve, and enjoy!
